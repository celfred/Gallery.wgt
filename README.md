A widget for OpenSankoré whiteboard software

This widget is an extension to the "Étudier" widget. It adds the following functionalities :
- Show index of slides to jump to any slide whenever you want.
- Show a random slide button to jump to... a random slide ;-)
- Speed option to set the transition speed between slides. 0 allows you to change slide instantly.

It uses the sudoSlider jQuery plugin. Thanks to its author.
